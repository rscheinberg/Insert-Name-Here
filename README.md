## Problem:
What is the boolean value of the statement "is there a way to get from the starting point to the treasure"?

## Recursive Abstraction:
When we are trying to answer the question "is there a way to get from the starting point to the treasure", the recursive abstraction can answer the question "is there a way to get from the starting point to the treasure by going through junction 0".

## Version Planner:
0: Working UserOfMaze Class, with appropriate test cases

1: Working Maze Class, with constructor, and the ability to make a maze layout as desired

2: Working UserOfSolver class, with appropriate test cases

3: Basic Solver Class, with constructor, and any helper methods that are necessary for the recursive solver method

4: Working recursive solver method

5+: Anything else that comes to mind
